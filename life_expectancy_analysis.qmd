# Abstract

Here, I re-examine the analysis of Oeppen and Vaupel (2002).

# Life Expectancy Analysis

This code is filtering through the data set to determine the maximum life expectancy by country.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
install.packages("gapminder")

gapminder::gapminder_unfiltered  |> 
  group_by(year) |>
  filter(lifeExp == max(lifeExp)) |>
  ungroup() |>
  select(year, country, lifeExp) |>
  arrange(year) ->
  sumdat
```
